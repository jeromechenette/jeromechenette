### Hi there 👋

#### ⚡️ About Me 

##### 🤖 Classroom Engineering Manager | 🚀 Software Engineer | 📈Data Nerd / Visualization Enthusiast 📊

I'm a software engineer and data nerd who thrives on transforming ideas into innovative web applications, creating exceptional UX/UI designs, and weaving data into compelling stories. I am an educator and team lead at heart and have had the privilege to guide 800+ students through a transformative experience of personal and professional growth.

I aspire to transition from a technical instructor role to an engineering manager role, bringing with me the skills of mentorship, management, empathic communication, and striving for technical excellence.

I have a wealth of experience in management of teams/classes of 30-60 and directing instructional support teams of 2-4. I excel at fostering career growth by seeking demanding and impactful work from my students, providing real-time feedback and coaching. I hold a unique expertise in being able to pivot between people management, engineering skills and instructional design, bridging the gap between highly technical and interpersonal skills. In addition, I am an exceptionally skilled communicator who values accountability, technical craft and creative expression.

My current area of focus has been instructional delivery and curriculum development. In that role, I have consistently achieved NPS (Net Promoter Score) exceeding 90+, and I regularly surpass weekly KPIs in various key areas such as student satisfaction, academic support, instructor clarity, instructor engagement, instructor knowledge, instructional delivery, and the overall student experience. This achievement is often rooted in my ability to craft tailored curricula that address recurring challenges encountered by different student cohorts. Additionally, I adapt course structures to pinpoint the most effective delivery methods for each new cohort, ensuring a dynamic and optimized learning experience.

I'm on a mission to make a positive impact by working on projects that matter. Whether it's building web applications that simplify complex tasks or crafting intuitive user experiences, I believe that technology can be a force for good, and I'm committed to turning that belief into reality. As an educator, I'm driven to empower my students; I embolden my students and team to adhere to the mantra ‘Embrace the Confusion’, finding excitement and playful curiosity when encountering something new.

I spend my days seeking out exciting projects to be a part of, problems to solve, and opportunities to create value.
